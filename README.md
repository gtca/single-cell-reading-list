# Single-cell reading list

A curated selection of blog posts on single-cell data analysis. This list is a (constant) work in progress.

The creation of this list was inspired by [Gopher Reading List](https://github.com/enocom/gopher-reading-list).

## Start here

- [Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data course](https://hemberg-lab.github.io/scRNA.seq.course/index.html) 

- [Introduction to single-cell RNA-seq technologies](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/introduction-to-single-cell-rna-seq-technologies/) with [slides here](https://figshare.com/articles/Introduction_to_single-cell_RNA-seq_technologies/7704659/1)

- [Current best practices in scRNA-seq data analysis](https://www.embopress.org/lookup/doi/10.15252/msb.20188746) paper (Mol Syst Biol 2019)

## Beginner

- [On stabilizing mean-variance relationship in scRNA-seq data](http://www.nxn.se/valent/2017/10/15/variance-stabilizing-scrna-seq-counts)

## Intermediate

- [Unique Molecular Identifiers â€“ the problem, the solution and the proof](https://cgatoxford.wordpress.com/2015/08/14/unique-molecular-identifiers-the-problem-the-solution-and-the-proof/)

- [Comment](https://www.charite-bioinformatik.de/publikationen_science_comment2017.php) on [Villani2017](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6335/eaah4573) paper in Science about new types of dendritic cells and monocytes in human blood

## Advanced

- [Linking scRNA-seq to scDNA-seq data](https://kieranrcampbell.github.io/blog/2018/11/13/clonealign.html) by Kieran Campbell

- [Low Rank Approximation of Kernels](https://twitter.com/GCLinderman/status/1094997866106507264) -- intuition behind [FIt-tSNE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0308-4). Also see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05804) about revealing fine-grained structure by adjusting degree of freedom.

### Autoencoders

- [Count based autoencoders and the future for scRNA-seq analysis](http://www.nxn.se/valent/2018/4/20/count-based-autoencoders-and-the-future-for-scrna-seq-analysis) by Valentine Svensson

- [Why variational autoencoders pursue PCA directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06775)
